# UFOs
## Overview of the Analysis
This repository contains code for a web app which publishes information from a database of UFO sightings. I have created the web app using HTML/CSS and JavaScript and it enables the user to filter the database based on the date, location and shape of UFO sighting. The web app is hosted via GitHub Pages and can be [found at this link](https://luke-c-newell.github.io/UFOs/ "UFO Sightings")!

### How to perform a search

## Summary
Overall, the web app has been set up to successfully filter the table on five distinct columns from the data. However, there is a drawback to the filtering functionality. If the user spells a search term incorrectly, or adds an uppercase letter to their query, the search function will break and return zero results. This could be rectified with further development, but for now, the user is nudged to enter the search term correctly by the placeholder data in the search boxes.
### Recommendations for further development
1. I could add a 'reset filters' button to the page that would allow the user to refresh the main table. This would avoid the user having to delete the text they have previously entered before starting their next search query.
2. I could also add a counter that shows the number of results returned by the search query. This would enable the user to quickly understand how many results are available for each of their searches.
